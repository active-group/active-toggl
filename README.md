# active-toggle

A Clojure program that obtains time entries via [Toggl](https://toggl.com)'s
REST API and outputs time entries as CSV for billing or time-keeping purposes.

## Usage

### Billing

To access your Toggle account you need your account's API token, see your [Toggle
profile](https://toggl.com/app/profile).

Then you can run the program like this:

    lein run <api-token> <start-date> [<end-date> <project>]

The dates for `start-date` and optional `end-date` need to be specified as
`yyyy-mm-dd`.  If no end date is specified, today is assumed.  `project` is an
optional project name that the program uses to filter time entries.

For example, running

    lein run 0123456789ABCDEF 2017-05-01 2017-05-31 cleaning

returns all time entries that are in a project called "cleaning" for the month
of May 2017:

    "Date","Duration","Description"
    "2017-05-02","1.00","Kitchen"
    "2017-05-08","2.00","Bathroom"
    "2017-05-15","5.00","Office"
    "2017-05-16","0.75","Garage"
    "2017-05-22","1.50","Basement"

### Time-keeping

To access your Toggle account you need your account's API token, see your [Toggle
profile](https://toggl.com/app/profile).

Then you can run the program like this:

    lein run -a <api-token> <start-date> [<end-date>]

The dates for `start-date` and optional `end-date` need to be specified as
`yyyy-mm-dd`.  If no end date is specified, today is assumed.
For example, running

    lein run -a 0123456789ABCDEF 2023-03-01 2023-03-06

returns all time entries that are in the specified period in March 2023:

    "Date","Start","End","Duration"
    "2023-03-01","07:30:00","15:00:00","7.5"
    "2023-03-02","07:30:00","15:00:00","5.5"
    "2023-03-06","07:30:00","15:00:00","6.5"
